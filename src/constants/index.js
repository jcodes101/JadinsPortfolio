My passions spanning from music production, fashion, and gaming—each playing a role in sparking my interest in the endless world of technology. 

What started as a question from 9-year-old me, "What makes my character Jump when I press 'X' on the controller?" has evolved into a drive to build, create, and innovate. 

Whether it’s coding dynamic applications, producing music, or exploring new creative outlets, I’m always seeking ways to push boundaries and bring ideas to life.`;
